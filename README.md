Welcome to the GUBI Boilerplate with TypeScript repository!

This repository is a boilerplate code for developing web applications using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The stack has been extended to include EJS, a popular templating engine for Node.js applications.

This boilerplate code provides a solid foundation for developing secure web applications, with JSON Web Token (JWT) and cookie parser authentication implemented, as well as middleware functions for protecting routes.

This code can be used as a starting point for developing APIs that can be accessed from React, Next.js, or any other web application framework. The codebase is written entirely in TypeScript, which provides a statically typed language for building scalable and maintainable web applications.

Feel free to use this boilerplate code as a starting point for your next web application project. Happy coding!
